<p>My work forms something of a focal anchor for meditation.
What is two-dimensional is distended, rendered entrail-like by the ‘gravity’ of an art space, much as a ravine is carved into a stone landscape by a stream.
At the core of my work is an emphasis on medium and process, and not necessarily message.
<br>I seek to give the material its own voice through my work.</p>
